## Introduction

The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset used for training image processing systems. This project uses a neural network to classify these digits with high accuracy. The complete workflow, including the dataset exploration, model training, and evaluation, is contained within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** A neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify MNIST digits.
- **Interactive Visualization:** The Jupyter Notebook includes visualizations of the dataset and the model's performance.

## Usage

To explore the project, you can open the Jupyter Notebook available in this repository. 

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SuchitaSri18/AI-Project.git
    cd AI-Project
    ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

    Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, then run:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook AI_Project_SuchitaSrivastava.ipynb
    ```
